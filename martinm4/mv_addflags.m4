dnl MV_ADDFLAGS([ADDCFLAGS], [CFLAGS], [AC_LINK_IFELSE],
dnl     [sh-list of flags], [sh-list of fatal-flags],
dnl     [sh-list of skip-flags, e.g. $CPPFLAGS], [action], [mode])
dnl adds each flag of [sh-list of flags] to [ADDCFLAGS] if [AC_LINK_IFELSE]
dnl succeeds with the corresponding [CFLAGS]. The flag is skipped if it is
dnl already contained in [ADDCFLAGS] or in [CFLAGS] or in
dnl [sh-list of skip-flags] or if it was already tested earlier
dnl (in case of positive earlier test, it is added, of course).
dnl [sh-list of skip-flags] must be *space* separated (not by newlines, tabs).
dnl It is admissible that [ADDCFLAGS] is the same as [CFLAGS].
dnl If [mode] is given and :/false, no COMPILE|LINK is done but just the
dnl result of [mode] is used.
dnl The [sh-list of fatal-flags] (if given) is added to CFLAGS during testing.
dnl The idea of the latter is that [fatal-flags] should be something like
dnl -Werror to make compile/link really fail on false flags and thus to
dnl avoid things like http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209239
dnl If [action] is nonempty then in case of a positive match the flag is
dnl also prepended to CFLAGS, and [action] is executed. action=break means that
dnl after a successful match no further tests are attempted.
dnl Note that if [ADDFLAGS] = [CFLAGS] and [action] is nonempty then
dnl the flag is appended and prepended, hence added twice; so better use
dnl a dummy variable in [ADDFLAGS] in this case.
