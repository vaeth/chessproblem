The binary demo program uses for output the library
https://github.com/vaeth/osformat
This must be installed first.

If you received a tarball with the ./configure file, you can use the usual
GNU type installation procedure:

./configure  (possibly with some options, see ./configure --help for details)
make
make install (possibly as root)

If you have the plain git repository, you first need to call autotools
(which you must have in sufficiently new versions):

./autogen.sh

will probably do the trick. Alternatively, you might try

./contrib/make.sh

which does everything (except "make install") with certain options
(see ./contrib/make.sh -h for help). This is convenient for me but
might or might not be suitable for you...
Similarly, there exist the commands

./contrib/tarball.sh
./contrib/cpplint

to create a tarball or to check all source files for google style compliance
(if you have cpplint.py).
Finally, when you have compiled "chessproblem" you can run a test suite with

./contrib/test.pl [-q] [path-to]chessproblem [chessproblem options, e.g. -j4]
