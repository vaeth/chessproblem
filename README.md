This project was written within about one day (plus about the same time for
testing/debugging) to train myself for a job interview in programming in C++.

I attempted to conform to the Google C++ style guide (1-2 exceptions are
explicitly justified in the code). Parts of the code (like the data structure
for handling castling and en passant rules in a quick manner) is inspired by a
program which I once wrote for the Commodore C64 in 6510 assembler and
addapted in 1991 for C; in 1992, I had slightly revised the latter, but since
then I had never touched it. The documentation of this original program
is in German, and it is available for download here:
https://www.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~vaeth/download/index.html

However, the latter was only used for inspiration: The current code is an
independent implementation, using concepts which I did not know explicitly
(only somewhat vague) 30 years ago...

I did not want to spend much time with a sophisticated build system, so I
just quickly adapted a variant of the build system for eix from
https://github.com/vaeth/eix/

The mentioned chess libarary is written with speed in mind.
Note that if you compile normally, there is an enormous slowdown in the chess
library due to many asserts: Disable them to get the full speed, using e.g.
`-DNDEBUG -DNO_DEBUG -DG_DISABLE_ASSERT`

The library uses some techniques like managing lists of nonempty fields
which the inspiring project had not implemented. Also it is simpler to use
(e.g. it generates only valid moves; the old library had generated moves
for which one would need to check separately whether the king is in check
after the move).

The __chess library__ consists of the files:

- `chess.h`:
	the main header which also documents how the chess library is used
- `chess.cc`:
	the implementation of the chess library
- `m_attribute.h`:
	auxiliary macros for compiler specific attributes to
	suppress/emit warnings or speed up the library
- `m_likely.h`:
	auxiliary compiler-dependent macros `LIKELY` and `UNLIKELY` for tests
	which might speed up the library

The library is written in such a way that it can easily be adapted for
different field sizes than 8x8.

Also the __chessproblem library__ is rather general:

- `chessproblem.h`:
	header and documentation for the chessproblem library
- `chessproblem.cc`:
	implementation of the chessproblem library

It is a general recursive multithreaded solver for chess problems.
There is no I/O: the output happens only over a `virtual Output()` function
which has to be overridden if output is desired.

The demo program is kept relatively simple:

- `main.cc`:
	the main function for initializing and calling the library

The usage of the demo `chessproblem` is rather elementary and unix style:
Just the data can be entered over options and arguments (or stdin).
Then the output is printed, and the program exits.
Since __chessproblem-2.5__, the demo program depends for its output on the
library

## Known Bugs

When threads are killed by the kernel due to lack of resources, segfaults
can happen: You might need to increase system limits correspondingly
if you observe in the system logs that threads are killed by the kernel.
Originally this bug was conjectured to be a race, because it was never
observed with `-j4` or less.
To mitigate this problem, `chessproblem.cc` automatically decreases the maximal
number of running tasks to the result of `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`.
More threads than this number cannot improve performance, anyway.
